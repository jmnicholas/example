How to contribute

Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests).
Please make sure all of your commits only have one feature per commit.
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should have a
paragraph describing what changed and its impact.

Thanks
Jennifer
